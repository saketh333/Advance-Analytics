#Shortest Path MCNFP Problem Formulation - data file for shortest path problem instance in lecture "Farm Distance"
#Charles Nicholson, ISE 5113

#use with MCNFP.txt model
#note: default arc costs and lower bounds are 0
#      default arc upper bounds are infinity
#      default node requirements are 0


set NODES :=  	0 1 2 3;

set ARCS := 	(0,1) (0,2) (2,3) (0,3) (1,2) (1,3);

param b:=	0  1     #for shortest path problem, start node supply = 1
        	3 -1;    #and the destination node supply = -1

#note: to make things a little more compact, you can use a "template" 
# for setting up costs.  See Chapter 9 "Specificying Data" in the AMPL textbook 

#for example, the first line below: [1, *] 2 5   3 10    
#is short hand for: [1, 2] 5   [1,3]  10   

#this comes in handy for some larger, more complex data files.
